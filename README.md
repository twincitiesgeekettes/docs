# Our Values

We're a community of women dedicated to helping aspiring and established female tech innovators. We believe that the more women get involved with tech design, development, and leadership, the more successful and diverse our companies and products will be in the future.

We value diverse voices. We honor the intersectionality of all experiences and believe that no one shows up as just one identity.

# Ambassador Expectations

## Community

As an ambassador you are a public figure in the community and are the face of Geekettes, both locally and globally. Be present in the community and know that you not only represent yourself, but Geekettes as well.

You are a role model for other women in the community. We strive to stay positive and optimistic. If folks say it can’t be done, we set an example of how one might do it and lead the way. Lead by example.

As community facilitators, we create a space, both online and in person, for people to feel connected and supported by other members of the community. This can mean coaching, mentoring, or policing when things don’t go as planned.

We are relationship builders within the community. We are constantly connecting with people who might become members, know someone who could become a member, want to sponsor, want to partner on an event, or simply want to support us in any way possible.

## Compensation

This is a volunteer position and there is no monetary compensation at this time.

## Time

*Monthly time commitment*

5-20 number of hours per month is typical. This fluctuates throughout the year and we know that some people will have other commitments that will come and go.

*Key meeting times*

- We meet 1 to 2 times at the beginning of the year as a group for a chartering session where we set goals for the year ahead. For 2016, we’ll plan to do this in the second half of January once the new ambassadors join.
- We meet as an ambassador group monthly to have a retrospective of the last event and start planning the next event.
- We hold monthly events the second Wednesday of the month at CoCo in Uptown.

*Additional meeting times*
- Possibly an additional in person or phone meeting the week prior to the event to make sure all tasks are delegated.
- Touch base meeting by phone/hangout the Monday/Tuesday before an event.

*Meeting/event locations*
- Most meeting and event locations are in the central Twin Cities. We meet regularly at CoCo in Uptown so that people can plan for the same date and location each month.

## Communication

We use slack to communicate regularly. Mentions typically get a 24 hour response. If it is more urgent, text or phone call instead.

We manage tasks within a main Trello board.

## Areas of Focus

We would like* to have leaders for each area of focus. Each person would take the lead but then delegate tasks as needed. *Would like to have leaders for each, but may not be feasible.
